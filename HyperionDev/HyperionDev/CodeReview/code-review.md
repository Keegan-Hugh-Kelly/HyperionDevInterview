## Option 1: Python Task | Anagram.py

class Solution:
       def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
      result = {}
      for i in strs:
         x = "".join(sorted())
         if x in result:
            result[x].append(i)
         else:
            result[x] = [i]
      return list(result.values())
ob1 = Solution()
print(ob1.groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))

## Review:

## Correctness:

The code seems to be correct in terms of solving the problem. It uses a dictionary to group the anagrams based on their sorted values. The output of the code is a list of the values of
the dictionary, which contains the groups of anagrams.

## Efficiency:

The time complexity of the code is 0 (n k log k), where n is the length of the input list and k is the length of the longest word in the list. This is because the uses the sorted function, which has time complexity of 0 (k log k), for each word in the list. The space complexity of the code is 0 (n k), as the dictionary can store up to n groups of k words.

## Style:

The code follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. The indentation is consistent, and the variable names are descriptive.

## Documentation:

The code lacks sufficient documentation. There is no function or parameter description, and no explanation of the approach taken to solve the problem. Adding docstrings or comments would improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and follows good style guidelines. However, it could benefit from improved documentation and there may be more efficient solutions to the problem.
